During an update to the server in September 2021 and an issue with the backup system, the site was corrupted. Some posts have been totally lost. All previous comments have been totally lost.

I have been running this blog regularly since 2013. I am manually restoring the posts one by one. If you have a post youâ€™d like to reference in particular, email me and I will prioritize putting that up.
