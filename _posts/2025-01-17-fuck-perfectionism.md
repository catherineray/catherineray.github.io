I have been working recently to counter the writers block that has formed insidiously from an unhealthy creeping perfectionism. In order to do this, I will post some old art and music which at the time I felt was "not good enough to share" or "inappropriate for a professional mathematician to have associated to them." But all of these labels and caring too much about what other people think -- I am sick of them. I don't want them in my value system. I just want to be my full authentic self. So I will be. Enjoy!
