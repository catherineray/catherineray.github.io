This paper of Honda was very hard for me to track down. It was not previously available digitally. I found it in a retired library volume in a thrift store in England. Hopefully, this digital copy will make it easier for others to enjoy Hondaâ€™s incredible insight and understanding of how to create power series in one variable with high amounts of arithmetic information, and in general of higher height formal group laws.
