_On the Formal Structure of the Jacobian Variety of the Fermat Curve over a \(p\)-adic Integer Ring_, Symposia Mathematica Volume XI (Volume 11).

This paper of Honda was very hard for me to track down. It was not previously available digitally. I found it in a retired library volume in a thrift store in England. Hopefully, this digital copy will make it easier for others to enjoy Honda’s incredible insight and understanding of how to create power series in one variable with high amounts of arithmetic information, and in general of higher height formal group laws.
