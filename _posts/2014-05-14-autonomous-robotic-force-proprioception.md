Iâ€™m experimenting with committing past projects to [github](https://github.com/catherineray).

Over the summer (2012) at George Washington University Robotics Lab - Positronics Divison (with Roxana Leonetie as my mentor and Gregory Colella as my research partner), we wrote a package for the PR2 using ROS stacks and Python. In short, the PR2 completes a task moving a dowel into a hole (using only force proprioception) as a response to dynamic stimuli.

If you are unfamiliar with the PR2:

Greg was relatively new to Python (an experienced Java coder), and I learned to code the same summer that we completed the project (previously, I had dabbled in mainly math and physics). Bear this in mind while viewing [our project](https://github.com/catherineray/PR2-positronics).

This is an early demo I simulated in [gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) of the PR2 learning to replicate arm movements (a major part of the project). Your browser does not support the video tag.
