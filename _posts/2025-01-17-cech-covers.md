[Cech Covers](images/Cech cover.m4a) (click the link to listen to us). I wrote this song with my old beloved room mate Christian Gorski in my last year of grad school while I was wrapping up my thesis. 

For weeks, I was doing nothing but computing etale sheaf cohomologies of ramified covers of the projective plane. I would decompose sheaves on these curves by cutting around the neighborhood of ramification point (the stomach), and capturing the properties of the ramification group from the ramification point (the heart). The gluing back datum was the punctured neighborhood of the sheaf.

Let \\(X\\) be a curve over a complete local ring, and let us decompose it into two affine pieces \\(X = A \cup B.\\) 

Given a sheaf \\(\mathcal{F}\\) over \\(X\\), we have the following Mayer-Vietoris sequence. 

$$0 \to H^0(X, \mathcal{F}) \hookrightarrow  \mathcal{F}(A) \times \mathcal{F}(B) \to \mathcal{F}(A) \cap \mathcal{F}(B) \to H^1(X, \mathcal{F}) \to 0.$$

In particular, if take the decomposition of \\(X\\) into the point at infinity and its complement \\(X = U \cup \{\infty\}\\), we get the following sequence, let \\(T\\) be a divisor at \\(\infty\\). 

$$0 \to H^0(X, \mathcal{F}) \hookrightarrow  \mathcal{F}(U) \times \mathcal{F}^\wedge_\infty \to \mathcal{F}^\wedge_\infty[\frac{1}{T}] \to H^0(X, \mathcal{F}) \to 0.$$

A global section \\(H^0(X, \Omega^1\_X)\\) can be specified by either a basis in terms of \\(\mathcal{F}(U)\\), in terms of \\(\mathcal{F}^\wedge\_\infty.\\) This is because we are considering \\(H^0(X, \mathcal{F})\\) as a subset of \\(\mathcal{F}(U) \times \mathcal{F}^\wedge_\infty\\). 


# Lyrics: 
I'll cut you into manageable pieces<br> 
I hope you're not too hard to glue back together<br> 
There's so many ways to form an affine cover<br> 
Yet I keep slicing open your stomach<br> 
And I pull out your heart<br> 
I don't know why<br> 
that's where I like to start<br> 
<br> 
It's an easy thing to fall in love with a hand<br> 
When its lifeless and the fingers are missing<br> 
I can trace the truth<br>
As it sits motionless<br> 
beneath my glass, slowly twitching<br> 
<br> 
And when I stitch it back together<br> 
It jumps and motions toward the sky<br> 
There's a hanging sequence of all of your pieces<br> 
And your other hand is waving hi<br> 
<br> 
I'll cut you into manageable pieces<br> 
I hope you're not too hard to glue back together<br> 
There's so many ways to form an affine cover<br> 
Yet I keep slicing open your stomach<br> 
And I pull out your heart<br> 
I don't know why<br> 
that's where I like to start<br> 
<br> 
Those intersections between your skin<br> 
Reveal raw flesh that I'm kissing<br> 
There's so many ways to stitch you back<br> 
I GIVE YOU MORE EYES MORE EYES MORE EYES MORE EYES<br>
YOUR DICK IS MISSING, i needed it to make more eyes<br> 
<br> 
I love to cut you apart to find the ways you combine<br> 
How many times can I do this before you fall apart forever?<br>
