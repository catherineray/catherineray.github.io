Texed notes of my reading course last quarter advised by [Yifeng Liu](http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~liuyf/), with fellow participants [Grisha Kondyrev](https://arxiv.org/find/math/1/au:+Kondyrev_G/0/1/0/all/0/1) and [Jora Belousov](https://arxiv.org/find/all/1/all:+AND+Georgy+Belousov/0/1/0/all/0/1). Our goal this reading course was understand some of Scholze’s recent work with perfectoid space techniques, in particular the proof of the monodromy weight conjecture.

Attached are only the notes I kept of my lectures, sometimes just outlines of what to talk about. I have had a few requests for these notes, and they are incomplete but I think they might still be helpful for others starting out in p-adic geometry.

During the reading course, I got the increasing feeling that we were just studying \(G_Q\) as fast as our little legs could take us — our little legs being our knowledge of varieties (over various non-archimedian fields like \(Q_p\) and \(F_p((t))\). So, I finished with a talk on the Grothendieck-Teichmüller group — another approach to \(G_Q\).
