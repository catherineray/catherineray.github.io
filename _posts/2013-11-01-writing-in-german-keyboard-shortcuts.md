Want to type in another language but you love your US keyboard layout?

Fear not. In Linux, this power is acquired as follows:

```
System Preferences -> Keyboard Layout
Click Options (bottom right-hand corner)
Expand Compose key position
Check Right Ctrl is Compose
```

Now that we have a functional compose key, we can utilize it to combine characters (sequentially). You now have the power to combine multitudes of characters; this is a German tutorial, so I’ll cover ß, ä, ü, and ö.

```
ß = RCtrl -> s -> s
```

This procedure imposes an umlaut on a, o and u:

```
ä = RCtrl -> " -> a
```

Tschüß und Happy Hacking!
