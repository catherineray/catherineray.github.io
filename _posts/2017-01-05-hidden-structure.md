Beauty wilts and love will flucture 
what remains is hidden structure
blushing primes sly chiding knots 
intertwine betwixt our thoughts
creation lives to create 
chipping from the ob’lisk slate
talk amoungst our little selves 
speculating filling shelves
search we will and see we’ll not 
blindness is our earthly lot
but the voice of the void is vast 
notice it through the nets we cast
