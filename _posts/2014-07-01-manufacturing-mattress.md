The context of this post is my [pressure ulcer prevention research](/pressure-ulcer-prevent/).

At the Thiel Finalist round, Adam Munich (my dear friend, [co-founder-to-be](https://www.facebook.com/aperture.co), and [fellow Fellow](http://www.thielfellowship.org/fellows/)) and I discussed the optimization of my elastomer pocket design. I encourage you to check out [his blog](http://adammunich.com/).

A few months later, Adam sent me the ultimate gift. Heâ€™s kindly permitted me to open source it.
