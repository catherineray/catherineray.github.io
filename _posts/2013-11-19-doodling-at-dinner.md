While at dinner and conversing with friends, I took out my notebook and began to doodle (~2 hours).

As I answered questions about my method of drawing/deciding what to draw, my friend pointed out that this drawing style (doodling whatever comes to mind) translates to somewhat surrealist pieces.

The classification of my drawing style isn’t something I’d previously considered, so I found this realization interesting.
