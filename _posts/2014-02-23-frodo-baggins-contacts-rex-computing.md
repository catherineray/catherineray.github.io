Interested usecases: “Scientific Computing”

Subject: Natural Resource Mining Oppurtunity

Message:

Eredor is only safe to drill for short intervals of time due to the current draconian government of the region. Due to this, the main restraint on the flourishing of our company is the lack of rapid data turnaround which is necessary for us to meet our drilling schedules.

We require optimized hardware for data processing and image analysis.

Any initial slowdown in collection of acoustic impedance data (which must be processed into a 3D matrix) delays the beginning of analysis.

Hello Master Baggins,

Thank you for your interest in REX Computing. This is a very interesting area that we are actively exploring and would be interested in working with you to capture this market. In exchange for providing evaluation systems for your use, we would be interested in access to any mithril deposits in order to work on new prototype systems requiring mithril oxide deposition techniques. In general, we believe that our product solutions would be able to accomplish your goals and assist in reconstruction efforts in Middle Earth.

Would you have any potential connections for recruiting in your land? I’ve CC’d our Chief Scientist and ex-Rider of Rohan, who speaks fluent elvish and dwarfish.

Thanks,

Thomas Sohmers CEO, REX Computing [http://rexcomputing.com](http://rexcomputing.com/)

Hello Master Thomas,

Unfortunately, mithril is not found in the mines of Erebor. The production of all new mithril stopped entirely after the fall of Moria, and this precious metal has become priceless. The only way we can obtain mithril is to melt down existing heirlooms and weapons to use as mithril oxide in your new prototype systems.

Given your need for large amounts of this practically extinct and priceless metal, I propose the following: Our Fellowship is glad to partner with yours in symbiosis if you partner with our company to overthrow the draconian government of Erebor and take back the hoard of the Longbeards: the largest dwarfish treasure hoard in Middle Earth. Your reward will be the doors of Moria which are inscribed with Ithildin, an alloy that contains mithril. We have removed the aforementioned doors and they are kept in an undisclosed location.

If our arrangement is broken, you will have no source of mithril-oxide besides that of our lovely Galadriel’s Nenya. This ring is ordinarily invisible to all but other ringbearers such as myself. I will warn her of your interest and warn you that the ring is unattainable and it is unethical to consider destroying it due to its role in her people’s preservation, protection, and concealment from evil.

On a lighter note, our company partners with teams of dwarfish engineers who would be glad to assist in the research and development of systems that may rid our mining system of inefficiencies to optimize production. All elvish engineers have been called in emergency to assist in the preservation of the kingdom of Lórien, and are unavailable to work on any side-projects at this time. However, I will alert them of your interest and keep you posted on their availability.

Fondly, Frodo
