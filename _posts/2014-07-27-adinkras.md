#### What is an adinkra?

Adinkras are **colored connected simple** graphs, that are **bipartite** and **n-regular**.

Adinkras are a **graphical representation of supersymmetry algebras**.

The prefix super- comes from the theory of supersymmetry in **theoretical physics**. Superalgebras and their representations, supermodules, provide an algebraic framework for formulating supersymmetry.

A [superalgebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superalgebra) is a \(\mathbb{Z}_2\)-graded algebra. In other words, it is “an algebra over a commutative ring or field with decomposition into ‘even’ or ‘odd’ pieces and a multiplication operator that respects the grading.”

#### What is an odd adinkra?

An adinkra is odd if the sum of every 4-cycle in the adinkra is odd. ![2](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2.png) To create an odd adinkra: we assign 0 or 1 to every edge of an n-dimensional cube such that, for each face of the cube, the sum of the edges of the face is odd.

#### How many unique n-dimensional odd adinkras exist?

Before we attack this, let’s elaborate on the problem:

First some notation must be fixed. By \(E(G)\), we mean the edges of the graph \(G\), and by \(Q_n\), we mean the graph corresponding to the \(n\)-dimensional cube. The formal statement is then as follows.

> How many edge 2-colourings \(\phi : E(Q_n) to {0,1}\) exist such that, for each 4-cycle \(C\) of \(Q_n\), the sum of the edge colours is odd: \(\sum_{e \in E(C)} \phi(e) = 1\) mod \(2\) ?

Note that we bastardize the term “edge n-colourings” \(\equiv\) assignment of \(x \in {0,1,..,n-1}\) to every edge.

#### Breaking Down The Problem: The Overture

Let \(e_n\) denote the number of edge colourings of \(Q_n\) for which the sum of the edge colours is even, and let \(o_n\) denote the number of edge colourings for which the sum is odd. As \(Q_0\) contains a single vertex and no edges, there are no edge colourings with either property, so we set \(e_0 = o_0 = 1\).

Now \(Q_1\) contains two vertices with a single edge between them, so \(e_1 = o_1 = 1\). The slightly more interesting graph \(Q_2\) corresponds to a square, which can have its edges 2-coloured in \(2^4\) ways. Half of which will correspond to an even sum, the other half to an odd, so \(e_2 = o_2 = 8\). The graph \(Q_3\) can be 2-coloured in \(2^{12}\) ways, half of which must be even and the other half odd, so \(e_3 = o_3 = 2^{11}\).

Conjecture: For all \(n\), \(e_n = o_n = 2^{|E(Q_n)| - 1}\).

When constructing \(Q_{n+1}\) from \(Q_n\) we are duplicating the graph \(Q_n\) and connecting every vertex of the duplicate to the original.

#### Combinatorial Approach

For a 2-cube: we have 2 different states [the sides sum to 1 or 3], and 4 unique rotational variants of each state. \(2*4 =8\)

Can we write this in a closed form? The set of all unique states of the cube is \(2^8\).

We have 8 different choosing points, one for each of the 8 edges. For each of these choosing points, we have 2 different options: pick 0 or 1.

What about for higher dimensions?

![Screenshot from 2014-07-26 17:31:21](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screenshot-from-2014-07-26-173121.png) ![Screenshot from 2014-07-26 17:31:40](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screenshot-from-2014-07-26-173140-150x300-1.png) ![Screenshot from 2014-07-26 17:31:10](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screenshot-from-2014-07-26-173110-132x300-1.png) ![Screenshot from 2014-07-26 17:30:53](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screenshot-from-2014-07-26-173053.png)

For the front face of the cube, we have \(2^{2^{n-1}-1}\)

For the back face of the cube, we also have \(2^{2^{n-1}-1}\)

The state of this edge is completely determined by this edge [following an intuition we will confirm in the following section]. Therefore, instead of adding 4 more options, we only add 2.

This gives us \(2^{2^{(n−1)}} \cdot 2^{2^{(n+1)}} \cdot 2^1 = 2^{2^n-1}\). \(_\blacksquare\)

#### Visually Formalizing our Intuition

Until we prove our hunch is correct, there is a hole in the induction step where one would need to show that many ways to glue to n-1 dimensional hypercubes together exist.

Intuitively, as soon as you fill in 1 edge (0 or 1) that fixes the rest of them \(\rightarrow\) meaning that there are only 2 valid ways to connect any 2 \(n\)-dimensional cubes into a (\(n+1\))-dimensional cube.

This can be visually formalized and inductively proven:

We can add the corresponding edges of the (n-1)-cubes to get a new (n-1) cube, and then the old problem of coloring the edges between the two cubes becomes the problem of coloring vertices so that the sum of the colors of two vertices is the same as the number on the edge between them.

# Generate a list of edges given a list of vertices

**altcube.py:: String typed n-dimensional cube (legal 4-cycles)**

If you represent the vertices as strings, for a hypercube you have:

0000 = 0 0001 = 1 0010 = 2 0011 = 3 0100 = 4 0101 = 5 0110 = 6 0111 = 7 0000 = 8 0001 = 9 0010 = 10 0011 = 11 0100 = 12 0101 = 13 0110 = 14 0111 = 15 The valid edges change 1 bit. So a face changes 2 bits.

One face would have vertices: 1001 = 9 1011 = 11 1101 = 13 1111 = 15

The edges are the ones that change 1 bit: 10011011 = 9,11 10011101 = 9,13 10111111 = 11,15 11011111 = 13,15

You can represent an edge with its odd/even by adding a bit:

110111111 = 13,15 is 1 110111110 = 13,15 is 0

So I can represent a n-cube as a string of all edge values.

To create a higher dimension I would just copy the cubes each twice to get the valid cubes, adding 0 and 1 to all of their vertices respectively.

So that one edge could be:

01101011111 = 13,15 is 1 and 11101111111 = 29,31 is 1

The new edges are all 1 bit off as before.

**square.pl:: Method of Computationally Generating Legal 4-cycles**

00 01 10 11 insert e as a placeholder, (ex:e00, 0e0, 00e) original[:pos] + ins + original[pos:] Pick all possible combinations of 4 vertices from vertices choose 4 Find legal 4 cycles: check that n slots are the same for each element of the array In the case of 3 dimensions, n=1

Example of a legal 4 cycle: (Ee00, E0e0, Ee10, E1e0)

We know it is legal because doing a columnwise AND

e00 0e0 e10 1e0 001 = 1 slot in common

[What is Geometric Algebra?](http://faculty.luther.edu/~macdonal/)

The geometric algebra \(\mathbb{G}^n\) is an extension of the inner product space \(\mathbb{R}^n\). Each vector in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is an associative algebra with a multivector in \(\mathbb{G}^n\), that is, it is a vector space that satisfied the following properties for all scalars \(a\) and \(A, B, C in \mathbb{G}^n\):

0. \(A(B+C) = AB + AC\), \((B + C)A = BA + CA\)

1. \((aA)B = A(aB) = a(AB)\)

2. \((AB)C = A(BC)\)

3. \(1A = A1 = A\)

4. The geometric product of \(\mathbb{G}^n\) is linked to the algebraic structure of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) by \(uu = u \cdot u = |u|^2 \forall u \in \mathbb{R}^n\)

5. Every orthonormal basis for \(\mathbb{R}^n\) determines a [canonical basis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_basis) for the vector space \(\mathbb{G}^n\).

Geometric algebra represents geometric operations on these objects with algebraic operations in \(\mathbb{G}^n\)

Coordinates are not used in these representations

[_What is a Clifford Algebra?_](http://www.av8n.com/physics/clifford-intro.htm)

Clifford algebras as commutative superalgebras with odd and even parts generated by the odd and even degree monomials, respectively.

[If you like](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/261509/whats-the-clifford-algebra), you can think of the real 3-D space as your vector space V with its regular inner product, and now imagine it sitting inside an algebra \(Cl(V)\). (I am omitting a lot of details in the interest of simplicity.) Since \(V\) is three dimensional, so you expect \(Cl(V)\) to have at least that many dimensions, but it turns out it will be \(2^3\) dimensional (and \(2^n\) dimensional for an \(n\) dimensional \(V\).)

Clearly there are many more elements in \(Cl(V)\) than just those in \(V\). The question is: do they have a useful interpretation? The answer is “yes”, because of the way things are set up. It turns out that subspaces of V can be represented as products of elements of \(V\) in \(Cl(V)\). Because multiplication is defined everywhere, you can now “multiply things in \(V\) with _subspaces_ of \(V\)”.

_How do we go between superalgebras and graphs?_

We could call a ranking of a bipartite graph \(A\) a map \(h: V(A) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_2\) that gives \(A\) the additional structure of a ranked poset on \(A\) via \(h\) as the rank function.

If you have said ranked poset and rank function \(h\), then we can identify \(A\) as the Hasse diagram of the ranked poset.

#### Proof from [Yan Zhang’s thesis](http://math.berkeley.edu/~yanzhang/math/thesis_adinkras.pdf)

[![Screenshot from 2014-07-21 23:19:22](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screenshot-from-2014-07-21-231922.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screenshot-from-2014-07-21-231922.png)

Instead of choosing 4 element sets as is outlined below in the Graph/Set theoretic approach, Yan defined an |E| element binary string (sort of like a bit mask) for each cycle with a 1 in each position where the corresponding edge belongs to that cycle (It’s easy to think about or draw in 2 / 3 / 4 dimensions). The become the rows of a matrix. You can define the coloring of edges as an |E| element 0/1 column vector and it is then possible to make the leap to say that the product of the matrix and the vectors will be a row vector of ones in the case of a successful odd dashing. Playing with that should make it clear that the rank of that matrix defines the dimensionality of the cycle space, which is equivalent to a number of similar linear algebra formulations.

\(v_n = 2^n\) \(e_n = 2e_{n-1}+v_{n-1}\) \(f_n = 2f_{n-1}+e_{n-1}\)

**A Promising Method & Proven Bijection**

\(\mathbb{Z}^E_2 \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^F_2/\mathbb{Z}^1_1\)

In the case of n = 3, we have edges and 6 faces

\(12 \rightarrow 6+1\)

\(2^{edges - faces}\)

(Rank Nullity Theorem)

The preimage of a point under a linear map is always the size of the kernel, thus there are the same number of even and odd legal colorings, and the difference between 2 odd cubes is always even.

**Alex’s Thoughts**

A null connection and its inverse give a higher order null connection, where null connection means none of the edges connecting sub-cubes are value 1:
