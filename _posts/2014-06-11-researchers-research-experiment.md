My default mode of research consists of many projects at once, spanning multiple disciplines.

As an experiment, I’ve decided to take:

- 2 weeks to **clear** most of **my mental cache**
    - **tying up loose ends** on current projects
    - **posting** a few **project ideas**
- 2-3 weeks to **focus on one subject**

I hypothesize that I will **gain an understanding of my optimal work style**.

Edit from the future (2022): I ended up picking up pure math as this aforementioned 2 to 3-week project and fell so deeply in love I decided to devote myself to mathematics professionally.
