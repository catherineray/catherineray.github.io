[Arbeit macht das Leben süß](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0IpBHTQQPJpV7qfxdOafuv?play=true&utm_source=open.spotify.com&utm_medium=open&fb_action_ids=10202929050419897&fb_action_types=music.playlists&fb_source=feed_music&action_object_map=%7B%2210202929050419897%22%3A732004050164910%7D&action_type_map=%7B%2210202929050419897%22%3A%22music.playlists%22%7D&action_ref_map=%5B%5D)

Above is the link to my current collection of unsorted work songs. The playlist is named after a German idiom which literally translates to "Work makes life sweet" (a belief I hold dear).

I suggest listening on shuffle. Enjoy! I'm always open to song recommendations!

_Sidenote: As stated in my song "[I Write Poetry In Python](/i-write-poetry-in-python/)" : "Put the period outside of the quotes! You’re not quoting the end of the sentence". This is a grammatical rule which I attempt to consistently implement. Apologies for the discomfort caused to those of differing grammatical views._
