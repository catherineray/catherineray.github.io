Do you have trouble remembering how to properly steer when driving in reverse?

I remember in two different ways:

(1) If you want the rear of the car to turn to the right, turn the wheel to the right. If you want the rear of the car to turn left, turn the wheel to the left.

(2) Imagine (when you shift into reverse) that youâ€™re sitting in the rear with the car in drive.

Then, turn as you would turn if you were sitting in the back and in drive.
