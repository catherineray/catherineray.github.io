_tl;dr In order to build your knowledge base, start with a question you want answered and work back from it._

## Competence in many skills > the mastery of only 1 skill.

Competency in a skill leads you to recognize beautiful executions of the skill; this gives you the power to appreciate the beauty hidden in the world around you.

_Example: If you study the art of trombone playing, you are more likely to appreciate the talent of a street musician that is playing high notes with rich timbre._

Wide-spread knowledge in [both art and STEM](/the-utility-of-art-vs-stem/) reveals connections between seemingly unrelated concepts; connections that others do not see. These connections often lead to valuable and creative solutions. [Overspecialization is dangerous.](/18-general-lessons-i-learned-in-university/)

Fostering your competency in many fields \(\rightarrow\) wide-spread aesthetic appreciation \(\rightarrow\) being a connoisseur of life.

**Complement mere competency** by studying a few select topics in enough depth to appreciate their deeper beauty and underlying simplicity.

**How, you might ask, do you achieve competency in many disciplines?** **Would you like to learn [physics||maths||…], but have no idea where to start?**

## 0. Start with a question that you want answered and work back from it.

This is an effective way to enjoyably learn any field!

Once you have an **interesting question to motivate you** and **esoteric terms to guide your reverse-engineering**, you have the motivation _and_ a plan to build your knowledge base.

## 1. Get excited.

After your burning curiosity pushes you past the _give-a-damn_ point, you give a damn about the basics of the fields that hold the answer to your question.

Having this excitement transforms the drudgery of simply-worded beginner books into a treasure hunt for the missing puzzle pieces you need to understand your interesting question!

## 2. Explain what you’ve learned.

Explain concepts to yourself &| to those willing to listen

**Understanding of a concept and the ability to explain the concept well go hand in hand**. Explaining what you’ve learned will reveal the holes in your knowledge base that might otherwise go undetected! Fill these holes.
