My topology curriculum is an example of [How To: Learn a New Discipline](/achieve-competency/).

#### 0. Build the map.

_The map_ is a high level representation of important concepts and connections — the threads that compose the subject.

I started by working through these two:

Where “work through” \(\equiv\) read carefully and annotate the text, take notes on important concepts, and complete a few exercises from each chapter.

_“Catherine, you said you’d teach me math. Why are you drawing squiggles?”_

_“Math is formalized art! I get to draw these squiggles on a page, describe them with symbols, and call it math.”_

#### 1. Learn by working through complementary perspectives in parallel.

- Hatcher: [Intuitive & Geometric Perspective:](http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf) \(\rightarrow\) understand it.
- May: [Category Theoretical Perspective:](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/CONCISE/ConciseRevised.pdf) \(\rightarrow\) believe that you understand it.

#### 2. Give weekly lectures on what you’ve learned.

I’m giving informal lectures to a small group of people on what I’m learning. These people ask questions and tolerate pauses to look things up.

_Don’t forget to ask for help when you get stuck!_

If you can’t find a satisfactory explanation online:

- [talk to professors/PhDs/postdocs](/why-young-innovators-should-answer-the-call/) at your local university (they’re people too!)
- post your question to a website such as [MathOverflow](http://mathoverflow.net/%20) or [Quora](http://www.quora.com/Mathematics).
