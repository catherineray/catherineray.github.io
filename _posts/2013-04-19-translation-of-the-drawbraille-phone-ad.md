I recently saw an add for a product I am excited for (although most blind people I know prefer Siri):

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Rin-2013-04-19-at-10.10.17-AM.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Rin-2013-04-19-at-10.10.17-AM.png)

For anyone [who is curious](/introduction-to-braille/):

The “screen” portion says: welcome to red-dot _(or redcomdot; probably the former)_

1 2 3 4 5 is listed in the column down the left side of the keypad, and 6 7 8 9 0 is listed down the right side.

I’m assuming that typing characters would be done using the 3×2 pad between the two columns of numbers.
