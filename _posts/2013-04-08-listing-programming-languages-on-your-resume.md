I love programming and know a few programming languages. Every programmer I’ve met has a favorite language, however, most of us can code in more than one language. As I was revising the ‘Language’ portion of my resume, I became confused.

_Should you mention all the languages you can code in?_

_What if they expect you to be practiced in (insert language you haven’t used in the last 3 months) and you fail the interview?_

_Should you be safe and only list the languages you are fluent in?_

_How do you simply represent skill level in languages?_

I decided to divide my knowledge of languages into “proficient” and “familiar.” Here is a guide on how to sort your languages into these two categories.

If you are “proficient” at a programming language, you can sit down and code (without consulting the internet or a book) and produce a functional program. You can write efficient, concise code in this language. If given source code, you can optimize it.

If you are “familiar” at a programming language, you’ve coded at least 5 functional programs in this. You can code a simple program with no bugs. If given internet access, you can produce a complex program. If given source code in this language, you can understand what it does and check for errors. You will likely think _“I know how to do this in (insert proficient language here)! How do I do this in (insert familiar language here)?”_ over 3 times while coding a simple program.

For example, my ‘Language’ section currently looks like this:

(I added my knowledge of Braille and Morse Code because it amuses me to present all types of languages in my language section.)
