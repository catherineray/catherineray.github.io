Here's something enticing and strange: the euler characteristic \\( \chi(SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) = \zeta(-1), \\) and the tamagawa measure of \\( \mu(SL_2(\Z)\backslash SL_2(\mathbb{R}) = \zeta(2)\\). That is, these apriori unrelated invariants of \\( SL_2(\mathbb{Z}), \\) the goodest boy and lovely example case, are dual zeta values. Is it a general pattern? Let's define and explain these results to spiritually prepare ourselves for the general picture!

# Euler Characteristics of Arithmetic Groups -- star of the show: \\( \chi(SL_2(\mathbb{Z})) = \zeta(-1) \\)

An arithmetic group is the integer points of an algebraic group (i.e. a group object in abelian varieties). For example, \\( SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) \\)  for alg group \\( \mathbb{SL}_2 \\).

In general, \\( \chi(G) \\) for arithmetic groups is related to L-functions and zeta functions. 

The euler characteristic is defined for a torsion free group \\( G' \\) as follows:  $$ \chi(G') = \sum_i (-1)^i H^i(G', \mathbb{Z}).$$  This is supposed to generalize the notion of euler characteristic for surfaces of polyhedra where $\chi(P) = V - F + E$, the analogy is to consider $\dim H^0(P, \mathbb{Z} = V$, $\dim H^1(P, \mathbb{Z} = E$, and $\dim H^2(P, \mathbb{Z} = F$.

For example:
- if we consider \\( F_n \\) the free group of rank \\( n \geq 0 \\) then \\( BF_n \\) has one vertex and n \\( 1 \\)-cells, therefore, \\( \chi(F_n) = 1-n \\)
- free abelian group of rank \\( n \geq 1 \\) then \\(n\\)-torus \\( (S^1)^n \\) has euler characteristic \\( \chi(S^1), ..., \chi(S^1)=0.\\)

The euler characteristic is defined for any group \\( G \\), in terms of \\( G' \\) a torsion free group, 
$$\chi(G) = [G: G']^{-1}\chi(G')$$

Note: This doesn't depend on choice of $G$, consider a two different torsion free subgroups $\Gamma'$ and $\Gamma''$, and define $\Gamma_0 := \Gamma' \cap \Gamma''$, then

$$\frac{\chi(\Gamma')}{[\Gamma: \Gamma']} = \frac{\chi(\Gamma_0)/[\Gamma': \Gamma]}{[\Gamma: \Gamma']} = \frac{\chi(\Gamma_0)}{[\Gamma : \Gamma_0]} = \frac{\chi(\Gamma'')}{[\Gamma:\Gamma'']}$$

It's time to stare at the Gauss Bonnet Thm: Let \\( Y \\) be closed Riemannian manfiold, then there's a canonical measure \\( \mu \\) in \\( Y \\) such that $$\chi(Y) = \mu(Y).$$

There's a version for orbifolds, \\( Y = BG\\) and let \\( X \\) be its universal cover, there's a canonical measure such that 

$$\chi(Y)= \mu(Y)$$

Further, \\( \chi(BG) = \chi(G). \\)

Let's look at \\( SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) \\). The free group \\( F_2 \\) is a torsion free group living inside of \\( SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) \\) via the ping pong lemma. It has index 12 (why?). 

Thus, $$\chi(SL_2(\mathbb{Z})) = [F_2: SL_2(\mathbb{Z})] \chi(F_2) = \frac{1}{12} (1-2) = -\frac{1}{12} = \zeta(-1).$$
