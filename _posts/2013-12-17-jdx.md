[My old laptop decal](/new-mediums-are-cool-stencil-like-vinyl-decals/) peeled away.

The phrase “JDX” is a motivator I write on everything from my notebooks to my bathroom mirror.

Grade 2 Braille for “just do it” translated into Grade 1 Braille is “j d x”. This is because “j”, “d”, and “x” are full word contractions in G2 when they are used outside of a word.
