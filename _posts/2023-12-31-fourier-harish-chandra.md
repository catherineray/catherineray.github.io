This post is written together *with Josh Mundinger*. Last time, we compared the Harish-Chandra isomorphism \\(Z(U\mathfrak g) \cong (\text{Sym} \mathfrak h)^{W,\cdot}\\) for \\(\mathfrak g=  \mathfrak{sl}\_2\\) to the Duflo isomorphism \\(Z(U\mathfrak g) \cong (\text{Sym } \mathfrak g)^{\mathfrak g} \cong (\text{Sym} \mathfrak h)^W\\), and found that they differ exactly by a translation by \\(\rho\\). In this blog post, we study just the Harish-Chandra map \\(Z(U\mathfrak g) \to \mathbb C[\mathfrak h]\\), using the Fourier transform to explain why the image is invariant under the dot action \\((W,\cdot)\\).Recall that the Harish-Chandra map sends \\(z \in Z(U\mathfrak g)\\) to the action of \\(z\\)on the Verma module \\(M_\lambda\\).The dot action of \\(W\\)is defined by \\(w \cdot \lambda = w(\lambda + \rho) - \rho\\).Thus, 
for \\(\mathfrak sl_2\\), we need to show that the center of \\(U\mathfrak sl_2\\) acts by the same scalar on \\(M_{\lambda}\\)and \\(M_{-\lambda - 2}\\).

## Twisted differential operators
The Beilinson-Bernstein localization theorem provides a geometric way to understand the universal enveloping algebra of a semisimple Lie algebra \\(\mathfrak g\\) through differential operators.
For a smooth variety \\(X/\mathbb C\\), the **sheaf of differential operators** \\(D_X\\) on \\(X\\) is the sheaf of \\(\mathbb C\\)-linear operators \\(\mathcal{O}\_X \to \mathcal{O}\_X\\) which locally look like 
\\[\sum_{i\_1,\ldots,i\_n} f_{i\_1,\ldots, i\_n} \frac{\partial^{i\_1}}{\partial x\_1^{i\_1}}\frac{\partial^{i\_2}}{\partial x\_2^{i\_2}}\cdots \frac{\partial^{i\_n}}{\partial x\_n^{i_n}},\\]
where \\(f_{i\_1,\ldots, i\_n}\\)are regular functions and \\(x_1,\ldots, x_n\\)are local coordinates.
More generally, if \\(\mathcal L\\) is a line bundle on \\(X\\), then the sheaf of differential operators \\(D^{\mathcal L}\\) on \\(\mathcal L\\) is the sheaf of operators \\(\mathcal L \to \mathcal L\\) which look locally as above. This ring may be expressed in terms of \\(D_X\\) by the formula 
\\[ D^{\mathcal L}  = \mathcal L \otimes D_X \otimes \mathcal L^{-1} \\]
In our case, we are interested in \\(X = \mathbb P^1 = SL_2/B\\), the flag variety for \\(SL_2\\).
Line bundles on \\(\mathbb P^1\\)are exactly \\(\mathcal O(\lambda)\\)for \\(\lambda \in \mathbb Z\\),
and we will write \\(D^{\lambda} = D^{\mathcal O(\lambda)}\\).

It turns out that the algebra \\(D^\lambda\\)makes sense even when \\(\lambda\\) is not an integer!
We have a map 
\\[\pi: \mathbb{C}^2\setminus 0 \to \mathbb{P}^1.\\]
This is a quotient map for the action of \\(\mathbb G_m\\) by dilation on \\(\mathbb C^2\\).
The derivative of the \\(\mathbb G_m\\)-action is given by the Euler vector field 
\\[ eu = x_1 \frac{\partial}{\partial x_1} + x_2 \frac{\partial}{\partial x_2}\\]
where \\(x_1\\)and \\(x_2\\)are linear coordinates on \\(\mathbb C^2\\).
In these terms,
\\[D^\lambda := (\pi_*D_{\mathbb C^2 \backslash 0}/(eu - \lambda))^{\mathbb G_m}.\\]
The above formula makes sense for any complex number \\(\lambda\\).The sheaf of rings \\(D^\lambda\\)is a sheaf of **twisted differential operators** on \\(\mathbb P^1\\).

## Infinitesimal action and a Lemma of Beilinson-Bernstein

The theorem of Beilinson and Bernstein relates \\(\mathfrak g\\) to the flag variety \\(X = G/B\\).
The line bundles on \\(G/B\\) are \\(\mathcal O(\lambda)\\) for \\(\lambda\\) a character of \\(B/[B,B]\\). 
In case \\(G = SL_2\\), then \\(G/B = \mathbb P^1\\), and \\(\mathcal O(\lambda)\\) for integer \\(\lambda\\)are the usual line bundles on \\(\mathbb P^1\\).


**Lemma** (Global Sections of D)
    If \\(G\\) is a semisimple complex algebraic group and \\(X = G/B\\) is the flag variety of \\(G\\), then 
    \\[\Gamma(X,D^\lambda) \cong U\mathfrak g/I_\lambda\\]
    where \\(I_\lambda\\) is the ideal generated by the kernel of \\(Z\mathfrak g\\) on the Verma module \\(M_\lambda\\).

The map in this Lemma is induced by the **infinitesimal action** of \\(G\\)on \\(X = G/B\\).
Given a path \\(\gamma: (-\epsilon, \epsilon) \to G\\) with \\(\gamma(0)=1\\), we obtain a family of automorphisms of \\(X\\); differentiating them gives a vector field on \\(X\\).This vector field depends only on \\(\gamma'(0)\\), and so we obtain a Lie algebra homomorphism
\[ \mathfrak g \to Vect(X).\]
In case \\(G = SL_2\\), \\(X = \mathbb P^1\\), we can calculate these operators on \\(\mathbb C^2 \setminus 0\\), then descend using the map \\(\pi: \mathbb C^2 \setminus 0 \to \mathbb P^1\\).
Here are formulas for the infinitesimal action on \\(\mathbb C^2 \setminus 0\\):

These formulas give a Lie algebra homomorphism \\(\mathfrak{sl}\_2\to \text{Vect}(\mathbb C^2 \setminus 0) \to D\_{\mathbb C^2 \setminus 0}\\),
inducing a homomorphism of associative algebras \\(U\mathfrak{sl\_2} \to D_{\mathbb C^2 \setminus 0}\\).
The image of \\(\mathfrak{sl_2}\\)is \\(\mathbb G_m\\)-invariant since the action of \\(SL_2\\) commutes with dilation.
So we get a ring homomorphism
\\[\mathrm{act}: U\mathfrak{sl}\_2 \to D^\lambda = \pi_\ast(D_{\mathbb C^2 \setminus 0}/(eu - \lambda))^{\mathbb G_m}\\]
for all \\(\lambda \in \mathbb C\\).
We have now given explicit formulas for the map in the Lemma above.


## Fourier
In this section we show that the Fourier transform descends to an equivalence of categories between the category of \\(D^\lambda\\)-modules to the category of \\(D^{-\lambda - 2}\\)-modules for generic \\(\lambda\\). The Fourier transform naturally transforms differential operators on a vector space \\(V\\)to differential operators on the dual space \\(V^\*\\).We show how this induces a map on twisted differential operators on \\(\mathbb P^1\\), where the \\(\rho\\(-shift will naturally appear.

Let \\(V = \C^2\\)with coordinates \\(x_1,x_2\\). On \\( V^\* \\), we will use dual coordinates  \\((\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial}{\partial x_2}) =: (y_1, y_2)\\).Note that for \\(\mathfrak g\\)acting on a vector space \\(V\\), the action of \\(x\in \mathfrak g\\)on \\(V^*\\)is defined as \\(x(v^\*) = v^\* \circ(-x)\\).
Thus, on the dual basis, we get the following action of \\(\mathfrak{sl}_2\\):

Note that these matrices are different than the ones we had before. In this basis, \\(E\\) acts by \\(-F\\) on the dual, \\(F\\) acts by \\(-E\\) on the dual, and \\(H\\)acts by \\(-F\\) on \\(V^*\\)

The Fourier transform \\(\phi: D_V \to D_{V^*}\\) is defined by 
\\[ \phi(x_i) = \frac{\partial}{\partial y_i}, \quad \phi\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\right) = - y_i.\\]
The goal of this section is to show that the Fourier transform \\(\phi\\) induces the following commutative triangle.

![](/images/Screenshot from 2023-12-31 17-42-15.png)

where \\(\mathrm{act}\\)is the infinitesimal action of the last section.
This commutative triangle implies that the central character of \\(\lambda\\)is the same as the central character of \\(-\lambda - 2\\), which gives us that the Harish-Chandra homomorphism is invariant under the \\((W,\cdot)\\)action.

We begin by showing the vertical arrow is well defined by an explicit calculation with the Euler fields on \\(V \\)and \\( V^* \\):
\\[\phi (eu) = \sum_i (-\frac{\partial}{\partial y\_i}y\_i) = \sum_i (-y_i \frac{\partial}{\partial y_i}-1)= -eu - 2.\\]
Hence \\( \varphi( (eu - \lambda)D\_{V}) = \varphi( (eu - (-\lambda - 2))D\_{V^\*}) \\).
Now \\(D_V\\)and \\(D_{V \setminus 0}\\) are not the same, as the latter is a sheaf on the non-affine scheme \\(V \setminus 0\\). Nonetheless we get a map
\\[ \varphi: D_{V \setminus 0}/ (eu - \lambda)D_{V\setminus 0} \to D_{V^* \setminus 0}/ (eu - (-\lambda - 2)D_{V^* \setminus 0} \\]
and thus \\(D^\lambda_{\mathbb P V} \to D^{-\lambda - 2}_{\mathbb PV^*}\\).

To fill in the triangle, we need to check that \\(\varphi\\) intertwines the infinitesimal action of \\(\mathfrak{sl}_2\\)on \\(V\\)and \\(V^*\\).
We calculated both of these earlier! The Fourier transform sends infinitesimal actions defined by equations (1), (2), (3) to (4), (5), (6) respectively. Thus we conclude the triangle commutes.

## Central Characters
By the Lemma (Global Sections of D), this commutative triangle induces the following triangle on global sections:
![](/images/Screenshot from 2023-12-31 17-42-53.png)
where \\(I_\lambda\\)is the ideal of the central character of \\(\lambda\\)under the Harish-Chandra homomorphism
This shows that the Harish-Chandra homomorphism is invariant under \\(\lambda \mapsto -\lambda - 2\\), as desired.

The reason that the shift \\(\lambda \mapsto -\lambda - 2\\)shows up in today's story comes from the Fourier transform of the Euler field. When the Fourier transform is treated in a more coordinate-free manner, the canonical bundle shows up. The canonical bundle of \\(\mathbb P^1\\)is \\(\mathcal O(-2)\\), and that \\(-2\\) is the same \\(-2\\) as in \\(-\lambda - 2\\). We will elaborate on this in the future.
