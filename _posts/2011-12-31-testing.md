While going through past notebooks, I came across a table I’d compiled which covered basic enumerative combinatorics.

| choose $r$ from $n$ | ordered | unordered |
| --- | --- | --- |
| no repititions | $\\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$ | ${n \\choose r}$ |
| repetitions | $n^r$ | ${n+r-1 \\choose r}$ |

Note that ${n \\choose r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$ and is pronounced “$n$ choose $r$”.
