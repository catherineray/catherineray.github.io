I wrote my Master’s thesis. This thesis is meant to fill a gap in the literature, for those starting out on their first larger calculations (ones which are too large for normal paper), and to emphasize some crucial differential finding tricks often left unpublished, or abandoned shivering in a footnote or side comment. This exposition will be repetitive, there will often be multiple proofs of the same things – the aim is to teach methods used by active topologists by showing them in action.
