Bra-ket notation is concise and useful.

A wavefunction is represented by a ket \(|\psi\rangle\).

The complex conjugate of wave function is written as a bra \(\langle\psi|\).

The complex conjugate of a variable is found by swapping the sign of the imaginary part of said variableâ€™s complex number, in other words: reflecting z across the real axis. For example, \\(z = x + iy\\) \\(z^* = x - iy\\)

A bra on the left and a ket on the right implies integration over dt. \\(\langle\psi|\psi\rangle \equiv \int\psi^*\psi dt\\)

Similarly \\(\langle\psi|\hat{X}|\psi\rangle \equiv \int\psi^*\hat{X}\psi dt\\)

My brief tutorial covered the basic usages of bra-ket notation in a quantum mechanical context; bra-ket notation is also used elsewhere.
