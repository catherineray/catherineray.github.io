Recently, I have been haunted by the number 1/2. It shows up in the Weil conjectures via the Riemann Hypothesis. It shows up in HKR-isomorphism when multiplying by the square root of the Todd class to amend the multiplicative structure. It shows up in the way we measure distance betwen vectors (\\(L^2\\) distance, anyway).  

Through a suggestion of Ezra Getzler, it seems one place begin to understand this root is to understand the Harish-Chandra isomorphism. This can be seen as the HKR theorem applied to the Poisson manifold associated to the dual of a Lie algebra. If you didn't understand that, don't worry, we will just talk about semisimple Lie algebras in this post.

Thanks to Alex Karapetyan for helping me to understand this and working through it with me.
