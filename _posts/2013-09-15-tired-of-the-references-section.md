Due to my accelerated graduation, I’m taking a lot of general education requirements this semester.

I’ve discovered that, unlike my usual computer science/math/physics class regime, quite few of these liberal arts courses require highly detailed bibliographies and references sections in specific formats.

[http://www.bibme.org/](http://www.bibme.org/) is a magical place with manual entry, multiple styles, and most importantly, an automatic look up of articles by article name.

I am a huge believer in maximizing time efficiency without jeopardizing quality, and this site facilitates just that.
