This post is an experiment in explaining math concepts via colorful hand-drawn diagrams.

At the recommendation of a few friends, I will likely add examples in the near future. If you find this post uninteresting/difficult to connect to ideas that you already have, I highly suggest you check out [this post by MathIsFun](http://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/groups-introduction.html).

Now that we’ve got that out of the way — we will delve into rings, fields, lattices, and categories.

Only then, once we’ve built your intellectual tool kit, we approach will the **applications of groups in physics and biochem.** Here’s a sneak peak of the introduction to lattice structures:
