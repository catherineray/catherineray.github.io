I've felt for a long time that automorphisms of curves should control or at least exert serious force on the slopes on their Jacobians. Symmetry forces height, as I've written about previously in [Models of Formal Groups Laws of Every Height](https://rin.io/every-height/), and [Endomorphisms Directly Control Slope](https://rin.io/height-is-symmetry/).  

In this post, I conjecture that the Frobenius eigenvalues of Artin-Schreier-Witt Curves (\\( \mathbb{Z}/p^k \\)-covers) are Gauss sums, generalizing an old and classic theorem of Davenport and Hasse (fuck nazis though). I explain and expand (i.e., make the paper type check and fill in details, like damn it's mad curt) a gorgeous reproof of this theorem using local systems by Robert Coleman.

This playful note is toward exploring this force, and outlining a conjectural approach for further exploiting it. Enjoy and click. [Read about my Gauss Sums :P](/pdfs/Gauss_sums.pdf)
