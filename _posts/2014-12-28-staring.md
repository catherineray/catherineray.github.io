And I sit here, undeserving,  
in a small flat  
staring out the window, dear.  
Thinking of patterns, and sometimes of regrets.  
Staring at symbols, trying to see what the author saw.  
Trying to be them, just for a second,  
to glimpse the beauty theyâ€™d uncovered  
by sitting in a small flat,  
staring out of their window  
thinking of patterns, and sometimes of regrets.
