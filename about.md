Before I was in math, I worked mostly in scientific simulation, autonomous robotics, and medical technology. I continue to work in chronic pain research. 


<details>
<summary>Here is a summary of my past non-math research and projects</summary>

  (In construction, can be viewed on my github).

  My first projects in robotics were in 2011: a dinky hexapod that autonomously followed people around, and Rubik's cube solving robot.
  
  In Spring 2012, I [became interested](http://rin.io/coupled-oscillator-love/) in physical examples of [nonlinear systems](http://rin.io/matlab-lorenz-attractor/) due to a [research project](http://thefutureofthings.com/4060-flexible-memristor-chips/) at the Chemistry and Physics Department of Mary Baldwin College, and modeled the resistant switching behavior of [flexible TiO2](http://books.google.com/books?id=Aey-h9lgcQgC&pg=PA111&lpg=PA111&dq=tio2+memristor+mary+baldwin&source=bl&ots=_Cxkt4ZyU8&sig=12ZG4phc_r1cNRkhmyg99YZ1dUc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=U0dcVN2RBdHToAT4u4LoDQ&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=tio2%20memristor%20mary%20baldwin&f=false).

Summer 2012, the [Positronics Division of the George Washington University Robotics Lab](http://robotics.gwu.edu/positronics/?page_id=9) took me under their wing as an intern. Our team smoothed joint movement of the Willow Garage Personal Robot 2 (PR2), alongside improving load equalization (below). I [programmed the PR2](http://rin.io/semi-autonomous-robotics-2012-my-1st-software-project/) to autonomously "learn" to place objects in holes with the corresponding shape (using only past motor position commands and the finger gripper sensors).

On the side, fascinated by the phenomena of producing argon plasma glow via the introduction of an RF source at 2.45GHz to a conductive cavity, I modeled the modes of conductive [polyhedra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldberg_polyhedron)[.](http://robotics.gwu.edu/positronics/?page_id=9)

After transferring to [GMU](http://rin.io/18-lessons/) Fall 2012, I extended their simulation for [predicting the material properties](http://rin.io/computational-materials-science/) of compound materials and explored [algorithms of AI chess players](http://rin.io/chess-engine/).

Spring 2013, an interest in contextual machine learning led me to write an [automated contextual analysis program](https://github.com/catherineray/CAMEL) that [learned the grammar rules of compressed Braille](http://rin.io/camel-paper/) from partially translated text. I used Braille as a test language, but this is a framework to automate the decoding of any partially understood (ancient) language by creating probabilistic dictionaries.\

Summer 2013, I interned as a software engineer at Cloudera. During my time there, I [developed a consumer download metrics tracking system for internal purposes](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2013/08/what-i-learned-during-my-summer-internship-at-cloudera/).

Fall 2013, I played with [SLAM and motion planning on the ARDrone](http://masc.cs.gmu.edu/wiki/DeformGroup). For HackMIT 2013, I collaborated with [Kartik Talwar](http://kartikt.com/) and [Spencer Hewett](http://www.skip.it/) to create a Google Glass application that [calculates the human pulse from the video feed](http://rin.io/hackmit-polyglass/).\

Early 2014, I briefly devoted my time to designing a keychain-sized food scanner [that detects gluten and other common food allergen proteins](http://rin.io/reframing-the-gluten-scanner/). From late 2013 to mid 2014, I dipped my toes into audio processing by automating the collection and classification of lab-animal vocalizations. Through this, I discovered that one can detect libido and stress change as early as preclinical trials.

![Bildschirmfoto 2015-06-05 um 12.43.17 vorm.](https://web.archive.org/web/20190213160322im_/http://rin.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Bildschirmfoto-2015-06-05-um-12.43.17-vorm..png)

Summer 2013-Spring 2014, I explored the improvement of mobility devices. A nonprovisional patent was submitted in Dec 2014 for the 5 pressure sore relief mechanisms that grew out of this. (I withdrew the patent once I decided to go into academia because I did not need to spend 5K on a design I wasn't going to use!)

Summer 2014, I became interested in neuroprosthetics. I started with the software side (convergence analysis of common decoder algorithms), and transitioned into playing with the hardware side ([optical recording methods](https://web.archive.org/web/20190213160322/http://rin.io/sensing-hardware/)).

Early 2015, I began mentoring Ada Rosa on mobility assistance for those with ALS and spinal chord injuries. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJxgEDr699w) is a video of her showing off the eye control feature.![](images/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Bildschirmfoto-2015-06-05-um-12.37.58-vorm..png)

In January 2015, I was a [visiting researcher](https://web.archive.org/web/20190213160322/http://www.santafe.edu/gevent/detail/arrival/1962/) at the Santa Fe Institute, and gave a seminar on [Simplifying Multiscale Modeling](https://web.archive.org/web/20190213160322/http://www.santafe.edu/gevent/detail/science/1963/). I still think about applications of topology to multi-scale modeling, and occasionally venture to consider modeling complex systems of a biological nature with an eye toward [immunotherapy](https://web.archive.org/web/20190213160322/http://www.infoiasi.ro/bin/Annals/Article?v=XXIV1&a=2) and [neuroscience](https://web.archive.org/web/20190213160322/http://xxx.tau.ac.il/pdf/1410.8826.pdf).

I stopped keeping temporal notes of projects around 2015. Most of my extra curriculars post moving to math academia have been artistic or biological. 

I studied Russian from 2018-2020 and spent 4 months in Russia in 2019, the end of my trip was right at the beginning of Putin's violent crackdown on Moscow. 

I continue to do biological research on the side, especially around chronic pain and it's relationship to mental health. An overview of that work can be found here: [The Biome](https://rin.io/biome/)

Over the period of 2021-2023, I collaborated with Chris Orta to design and tattoo two massive full robot-skeleton snakes going from the top of my back to my mid calf. In the summer of 2023, I got heavily into street art graffiti, learning from my artistic collaborator Daniel Burnett: some samples of my graffiti work can be seen in the art section of my webpage. I have traveled around the U.S. and Europe making graffiti since.

In August 2023, I joined Chris Walker and a group of other fabulous artists to finish up and sail a boat made from a bouncy castle, which we lived on for a week.

My dear friend Petra Flurin and I wrote a comic together called Endomortis, more on that soon!

I am currently a [postdoc at Uni-Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/FB10srvi/persdb/MM-member.php?id=1772) in the Arithmetic and Homotopy Theory Working Group lead by [Thomas Nikolaus](https://www.uni-muenster.de/IVV5WS/WebHop/user/nikolaus/index.html) and [Christopher Deninger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Deninger). Here's a recent interview I did as part of On a Tangent: Voices of Mathematics Muenster: [How an Inventor becomes a Mathematican](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6yw6nazYdvFW4lp24rolZd?si=kOzCIF7lQYeGPBlgWI-gjg).

Before that, I graduated from [George Mason University at 16](http://newsdesk.gmu.edu/2013/12/mason-celebrates-winter-graduates/) with a B.S. in Computational Physics, and accepted the [Thiel Fellowship](http://www.thielfellowship.org/about/about-the-fellowship/) in 2014 to develop medical technology and study mathematics under my mentor, [Edward Frenkel](http://www.edwardfrenkel.com/). I graduated with my Master's degree from UChicago working with [Peter May](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/) and [Kazuya Kato (加藤 和也)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuya_Kato), and with my PhD from Northwestern working with [Paul Goerss](https://sites.math.northwestern.edu/~pgoerss/).

Moduli Stacks of Curves in Homotopy Theory:
The group cohomology of the maximal finite subgroups of the Lubin-Tate action is the E_2 page needed to capture all p-torsion information in the stable homotopy groups of spheres, and the only nontrivial p-torsion for odd primes is found at heights $p^{k-1}(p-1)$. 

My thesis (from 2023) attempts to resolve a 40 year old conjecture describing the Lubin-Tate action for all maximal finite subgroups, in the process proividing a higher height alternative to tmf which does not use Shimura varieties.  A key insight is to replace the role of level structures with higher ramification information. To make the thesis more digestible, I have broken it up into 3 parts which are forthcoming.
