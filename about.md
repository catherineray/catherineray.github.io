Before I was in math, I worked mostly in scientific simulation, autonomous robotics, and medical technology. I continue to work in chronic pain research, which you can read about [here](https://rin.io/biome/). 

I am currently a [postdoc at Uni-Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/FB10srvi/persdb/MM-member.php?id=1772) in the Arithmetic and Homotopy Theory Working Group lead by [Thomas Nikolaus](https://www.uni-muenster.de/IVV5WS/WebHop/user/nikolaus/index.html) and [Christopher Deninger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Deninger). Here's a recent interview I did as part of On a Tangent: Voices of Mathematics Muenster: [How an Inventor becomes a Mathematican](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6yw6nazYdvFW4lp24rolZd?si=kOzCIF7lQYeGPBlgWI-gjg).

Before that, I graduated from [George Mason University at 16](http://newsdesk.gmu.edu/2013/12/mason-celebrates-winter-graduates/) with a B.S. in Computational Physics, and accepted the [Thiel Fellowship](http://www.thielfellowship.org/about/about-the-fellowship/) in 2014 to develop medical technology and study mathematics under my mentor, [Edward Frenkel](http://www.edwardfrenkel.com/). I graduated with my Master's degree from UChicago working with [Peter May](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/) and [Kazuya Kato (加藤 和也)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuya_Kato), and with my PhD from Northwestern working with [Paul Goerss](https://sites.math.northwestern.edu/~pgoerss/).

If you are interested in my research mathematics, a few fun papers are below. 
(You will find the name Catherine Ray on my old research papers and Rin Ray on my newer works, these both refer to the same person. I prefer Rin nowadays.)

Moduli Stacks of Curves in Homotopy Theory:

The group cohomology of the maximal finite subgroups of the Lubin-Tate action is the E_2 page needed to capture all p-torsion information in the stable homotopy groups of spheres. My thesis (2023) attempts to resolve the 40 year old open problem of describing the Lubin-Tate action for all maximal finite subgroups. It does so by outlining a universal way to build a geometric model using a moduli stack of \\( G \\)-curves given a subgroup \\( G \\).  A key insight is to replace the role of level structures with higher ramification information. To make the thesis more digestible, I have broken it up into 3 parts, the last of which is forthcoming. The only nontrivial p-torsion for odd primes is found at heights \\( p^{k-1}(p-1) \\).
