My name is Cathe**rin**e Ray (they/them), and I'm a mathematician and artist. 

My current mathematical research is on arithmetic patterns in homotopy theory and physics. I also work in chronic pain research. Before I was in math, I worked mostly in scientific simulation, autonomous robotics, and medical technology.

I graduated from [George Mason University at 16](http://newsdesk.gmu.edu/2013/12/mason-celebrates-winter-graduates/) with a B.S. in Computational Physics, and accepted the [Thiel Fellowship](http://www.thielfellowship.org/about/about-the-fellowship/) in 2014 to study mathematics full time under my mentor, [Edward Frenkel](http://www.edwardfrenkel.com/). I graduated with my Master's degree from UChicago working with [Peter May](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/), and with my PhD from Northwestern working with Paul Goerss. I am currently a postdoc at Uni-Münster in the Arithmetic and Homotopy Theory Working Group lead by Thomas Nikolaus and Christopher Deninger.

[Here](pdfs/application_general_audience.pdf) is a summary of my work as a graduate student for a general audience, including original illustrations.
