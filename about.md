My name is Cathe**rin**e Ray (they/them), and I'm a mathematician. 

My current mathematical research is on arithmetic patterns in homotopy theory and physics. Before I was in math, I worked mostly in scientific simulation, autonomous robotics, and medical technology. I continue to work in chronic pain research and make lots of art!

I graduated from [George Mason University at 16](http://newsdesk.gmu.edu/2013/12/mason-celebrates-winter-graduates/) with a B.S. in Computational Physics, and accepted the [Thiel Fellowship](http://www.thielfellowship.org/about/about-the-fellowship/) in 2014 to study mathematics full time under my mentor, [Edward Frenkel](http://www.edwardfrenkel.com/). I graduated with my Master's degree from UChicago working with [Peter May](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/), and with my PhD from Northwestern working with Paul Goerss. I am currently a postdoc at Uni-Münster in the Arithmetic and Homotopy Theory Working Group lead by Thomas Nikolaus and Christopher Deninger.

[Here](pdfs/application_general_audience.pdf) is a summary of my work as a graduate student for a general audience, including original illustrations.

  <summary>Here is a summary of my past research.</summary>
  (Currently under construction, mind the mess). 
  
  My first projects in robotics were in 2011: a dinky hexapod that autonomously followed people around, and Rubik's cube solving robot.

  In Spring 2012, I [became interested](http://rin.io/coupled-oscillator-love/) in physical examples of [nonlinear systems](http://rin.io/matlab-lorenz-attractor/) due to a [research project](http://thefutureofthings.com/4060-flexible-memristor-chips/) at the Chemistry and Physics Department of Mary Baldwin College, and modeled the resistant switching behavior of [flexible TiO2](http://books.google.com/books?id=Aey-h9lgcQgC&pg=PA111&lpg=PA111&dq=tio2+memristor+mary+baldwin&source=bl&ots=_Cxkt4ZyU8&sig=12ZG4phc_r1cNRkhmyg99YZ1dUc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=U0dcVN2RBdHToAT4u4LoDQ&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=tio2%20memristor%20mary%20baldwin&f=false).

  Summer 2012, the [Positronics Division of the George Washington University Robotics Lab](http://robotics.gwu.edu/positronics/?page_id=9) took me under their wing as an intern. Our team smoothed joint movement of the Willow Garage Personal Robot 2 (PR2), alongside improving load equalization (below). I [programmed the PR2](http://rin.io/semi-autonomous-robotics-2012-my-1st-software-project/) to autonomously "learn" to place objects in holes with the corresponding shape (using only past motor position commands and the finger gripper sensors).

  On the side, fascinated by the phenomena of producing argon plasma glow via the introduction of an RF source at 2.45GHz to a conductive cavity, I modeled the modes of conductive [polyhedra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldberg_polyhedron).

  After transferring to [GMU](http://rin.io/18-lessons/) Fall 2012, I extended their simulation for [predicting the material properties](http://rin.io/computational-materials-science/) of compound materials and explored [algorithms of AI chess players](http://rin.io/chess-engine/).
  
  Spring 2013, an interest in contextual machine learning led me to write an [automated contextual analysis program](https://github.com/catherineray/CAMEL) that [learned the grammar rules of compressed Braille](http://rin.io/camel-paper/) from partially translated text. I used Braille as a test language, but this is a framework to automate the decoding of any partially understood (ancient) language by creating probabilistic dictionaries.![Screenshot from 2014-11-06 21:45:28](images/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screenshot-from-2014-11-06-214528.png)
  
  Summer 2013, I interned as a software engineer at Cloudera. During my time there, I [developed a consumer download metrics tracking system for internal purposes](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2013/08/what-i-learned-during-my-summer-internship-at-cloudera/).
  
  Fall 2013, I played with [SLAM and motion planning on the ARDrone](http://masc.cs.gmu.edu/wiki/DeformGroup). For HackMIT 2013, I collaborated with [Kartik Talwar](http://kartikt.com/) and [Spencer Hewett](http://www.skip.it/) to create a Google Glass application that [calculates the human pulse from the video feed](http://rin.io/hackmit-polyglass/).

  Early 2014, I briefly devoted my time to designing a keychain-sized food scanner [that detects gluten and other common food allergen proteins](http://rin.io/reframing-the-gluten-scanner/). From late 2013 to mid 2014, I dipped my toes into audio processing by automating the collection and classification of rodent vocalizations. Through this, I discovered that one can detect libido and stress change as early as preclinical trials.

  Summer 2013-Spring 2014, I explored the improvement of mobility devices. A nonprovisional patent was submitted in Dec 2014 for the 5 pressure sore relief mechanisms that grew out of this.
  
  Summer 2014, I became interested in neuroprosthetics. I started with the software side (convergence analysis of common decoder algorithms), and transitioned into playing with the hardware side ([optical recording methods](http://rin.io/sensing-hardware/)).

  In autumn 2014, I began to teach myself algebraic topology full-time. 
  
  Early 2015, I began mentoring Ada Rosa on mobility assistance for those with ALS and spinal chord injuries. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJxgEDr699w) is a video of her showing off the eye control feature.![](images/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Bildschirmfoto-2015-06-05-um-12.37.58-vorm..png)

  In January 2015, I was a [visiting researcher](http://www.santafe.edu/gevent/detail/arrival/1962/) at the Santa Fe Institute, and gave a seminar on [Simplifying Multiscale Modeling](http://www.santafe.edu/gevent/detail/science/1963/). I still think about applications of topology to multi-scale modeling, and occasionally venture to consider modeling complex systems of a biological nature with an eye toward [immunotherapy](http://www.infoiasi.ro/bin/Annals/Article?v=XXIV1&a=2) and [neuroscience](http://xxx.tau.ac.il/pdf/1410.8826.pdf).
